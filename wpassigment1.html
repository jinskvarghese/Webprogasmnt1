        Hi! I am Jins K. Varghese.

    <div id="strengths" class="content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dedication: I have a strong passion for videography, video editing, and photography, and I am dedicated and enthusiastic about pursuing these creative fields.</li>
                <li>Leadership: I possess excellent event organizing skills, coupled with strong leadership qualities, enabling me to plan, coordinate, and lead successful events with efficiency and precision.</li>
                <li>Commitment: My competitive skills are complemented by a strong commitment to continuous learning, allowing me to adapt and excel in dynamic environments while consistently improving my abilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="weaknesses" class="content">
        <p>
            <strong>Weaknesses</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfectionism: I tend to be a perfectionist, which can sometimes lead to spending too much time on tasks and missing deadlines.</li>
                <li>Procrastination: I occasionally procrastinate on tasks, especially when they are less enjoyable or require a lot of effort, which can lead to last-minute stress.</li>
                <li>Delegation Difficulty: I find it hard to delegate tasks, as I tend to prefer taking on more responsibilities myself, which can lead to burnout and inefficiency.</li>
                <li>Difficulty Saying No: I find it hard to say no to requests from others, which sometimes results in overcommitting and spreading myself too thin.</li>
            </ul>
